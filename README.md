The main objective of our project is to analyse the IPL stats of various matches and teams. An Interactive AI Chatbot is also created using IBM Watson Assistant which serves as an IPL guide for beginners. Dashboards are created for individual teams to provide an insight of their performance from the beginning of IPL. Future scores pertaining to a match are predicted.
